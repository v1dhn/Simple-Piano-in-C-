# Simple-Piano-in-Cpp
This project is created using Dev-Cpp.
Firstly, you need to paste winbgim.h, libbgi.a, graphics.h in C:\Program Files (x86)\Dev-Cpp\MinGW64\lib or equivalent folder.
Now edit the code and change the path of note folder (if required). I was using it in my F drive. IT'S NECESSARY TO ACCESS THE NOTES.
There were changes made to linkers in devcpp and it works on TDM-GCC 32-bit Release. So for the ease, I have made a .dev file. It keeps the settings stored.
Enjoy :)
